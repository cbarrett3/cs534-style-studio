    <h4 class="section-header">Project description</h4>
    <p>For our group project, we desire to implement a “styleStudio” application. The user will upload a selfie and
      then is able to customize his/her look from the list of features below <a href="#features">[1]</a>. Our idea is
      inspired by our belief
      that people should be encouraged to express themselves in new, fun, and creative ways. We want to empower the
      user to try out new styles, while bringing a smile to their face at the same time. Another potential benefit of
      our application is that it will provide users the courage to try out a new look after seeing a digital
      representation of how it will make them look.</p>
    <p>
      The features of the application will range from facial hair manipulations to piercings. The picture uploaded must
      be a shoulder-up selfie; if our program does not detect a clear face on the image, then it will display an error
      message asking for another photograph. Once the program is supplied with a valid photograph, we will use a Matlab
      script to manipulate the selfie appearance. The application interface will include several buttons with features
      or enhancements to add to your photograph. One can add piercings, makeup, mustaches, different hair colors and
      styles, beards, etc. to their face. Up to 3 features or enhancements can be applied at the same time. </p>
    <p>
      The end goal of our program is for a user to be able to get a feel for what they would look like in different
      styles with a simple, customizable, computer-generated image. Many people enjoy expressing themselves in creative
      and unique ways; we feel like this program will offer a useful experience before committing to a real life
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>By our midterm report deadline, our goal is to have researched and practiced implementing Matlab image
      processing techniques regarding face modifications and alterations, developed the photo uploading and face
      validity feature, and created one or two of the possible features listed below. We also plan to have explored
      different graphical user interface (GUI) possibilities for our application. By our presentation deadline, we plan
      to have multiple features created, that can be applied at once to the image, in addition to a working website
      explaining how the application works and where to download it. A more detailed timeline can be found below <a
        href="#timeline">[2]</a>.
